## Instructions for Sprint #2
Run board.py from the main branch to see the game board and basic functionality. Turn logic isn't complete in the front end yet, but you are able to:
- Click on two cities and a pop up will show up asking which cards you'd like to use. Will only allow you to place trains if you select an allowable color for that route (currently trains are placed at the first available route for double routes which needs to be fixed).
- Draw cards from the deck and have the player's card numbers (top right of the cards pannel) increase accordingly
- Draw face up cards and "take" or not take the cards. The player's card numbers will increase with each card taken. Next step is adding logic to limit the number of cards you pick.
