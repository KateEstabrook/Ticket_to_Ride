# Ticket to Ride
### CS 3050 (Software Engineering) Final Project
### Group #1 - Elisabeth, Kate, Mateo, Oliver


## Project Description
We created the classic board game, Ticket to Ride, using Python Arcade. It is a 4 player game with 1 human player and 3 computer players.

## Instructions for playing

Packages needed: 
- platform
- arcade
- heapq

Run board.py.
- You will be instructed to choose a color. There will be AIs for the other three colors.
- An instruction menu will pop up. If you know how to play, click "Exit"
- Choose your destination cards
- Remember, that in each turn you can either choose a destination card (or more), place a route, or draw a card.
- When a player has 3 or fewer trains left, everyone *besides* that player will get one more turn. After that you will be sent to the win screen. To exit the win screen, just press escape.

Enjoy!
